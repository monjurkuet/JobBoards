We are focused on one thing: defining a new standard for service in freight, pushing the limits of what’s possible for ourselves and our partners every day.

At Arrive Logistics, our relentless pursuit of perfection fuels our ability to optimize operations, identify efficiencies, build technology and deliver innovation that pushes businesses like yours forward. But it’s not just what we do that sets us apart from everyone else — it’s what we’re made of: grit, determination and a 24/7 commitment to our partners.

The details matter. We don’t just connect freight and carriers; we think critically about every element of the process, working with precision to anticipate your needs. That means more capacity, a consistent freight experience — no surprises.

We’re proud of what we have accomplished since 2014. What was once a 10-person team in a small office in Austin, TX is now an organization of more than 1,000 world-class problem solvers working out of Austin and Chicago. Reaching $30 million in truckload sales during our first year in business validated our theory that shippers want more out of their supply chain partners.

We hold ourselves to high standards in every material, process, and person that plays a part in our work, and we embrace difference by design because diverse perspectives are at the heart of creativity. We find brilliance in the intersections—of beauty and function, of heritage and innovation, of accessibility and aspiration—which is how we break through with magic and logic in our culture and our craft. 

The result is that we stand taller together. Tapestry elevates the best in our people and brands. We use our collective strengths to move our customers and empower our communities, to make the fashion industry sustainable, and to build a house that’s equitable, inclusive, and diverse.

Our model doesn’t rely on overdraft, monthly service, minimum balance, or other member fees—it just focuses on delivering member value.

How does Chime work? We partner with regional banks to design member-first financial products. This creates a more competitive market with better, lower-cost options for everyday Americans who aren’t being served well by traditional banks. We offer access to bank accounts with fee-free overdraft, provide members the chance to receive early access to their paychecks, help them improve their credit, and more!

We help drive innovation, inclusion, and access across the industry with one of the most experienced leadership teams in fintech guiding us along the way. We were recently valued at over $25.5B and we’ve raised over $1.7B in funding from leading investors including Sequoia Capital Global Equities, SoftBank Vision Fund 2, General Atlantic, Tiger Global, Dragoneer, DST, Coatue, Iconiq, Menlo Ventures and others.

We use tech to make amazing products and invest heavily in humans to help our clients with their business services needs.

Two Barrels is family-owned and operated, employs over 650 good humans across the nation, and services over 3 million active businesses nationwide. As we've grown, we've maintained a 95% employee retention rate. We have no debt, no investors, no venture capital, and no private equity.

What does it mean to be family-owned and operated?

Well, it's not perfect. But growth, profits, KPIs, endless investor meetings, warrants, options pools, vesting, or manipulating employees to be indentured servants in exchange for paper shares that won't make you rich, aren't things we have to deal with here.

We try to do good work and see where it goes. That's our actual mission statement. We try to make our customers and our employees happy. We get to focus on that versus making investors happy. We are well aware of competing with startups, and VC and PE-funded, or worse yet, public companies' total compensation packages, so we bring it up. We are different. Our packages include an excellent salary and 401K to buy stock wherever you want. We try to make our overall benefits better each year as we grow. We offer tough challenges—focusing on the journey as the reward, not the finish line. We try to hire people we enjoy being around.

We're not a platform or an AI cool guy place. We're not software as a service/whatever is the cool thing that gives investors a reason to ask for a higher multiple on their next round of stock dilution. Whoops, I mean, investment for the future.

As 2020 taught us, the unexpected can occur anywhere, at any time, radically affecting the health and safety of people and business operations. Real-time data is crucial for enhancing organizational agility, sustaining business continuity, and responding with speed and confidence. This is especially true as the landscape of public data sources expands and diversifies, spanning social media, information sensors, blogs, and the deep web.

Dataminr processes billions of data units daily from 100,000+ public information sources in 100+ languages and in multiple formats -- including text, images, video, sound, and public sensor data. We use many different AI/ML techniques and methods such as natural language processing, understanding, and generation; computer vision; audio processing and classification, and anomaly detection on machine-generated data streams. Dataminr continuously trains its AI models on an accumulated 10-year archive of trillions of public data units and over 100 million critical local, national and global events while the company’s numerous AI models are all built, trained, and continuously updated by a team of data scientists, engineers, and researchers. 

In alignment with our belief that AI and real-time data should be a force for good, we forged a partnership with the United Nations in 2019, at the AI for Good Summit in Geneva. The partnership equips thousands of UN personnel with Dataminr’s First Alert. The initiative boosts the UN’s utilization of cutting-edge technology and provides their agencies and personnel with the earliest possible indications of emerging crises, accelerating humanitarian response efforts around the world.

Approximately 70,000 petitions are created and supported on our platform every month, with 1.7 million new people joining our global network of users every week. People on Change.org have powered tens of thousands of campaign victories worldwide, and more are winning every week.

Every day, our users collaborate to organize on local, national and global issues; hold corporations to account; and demand action from decision makers at the highest levels of government and business. Our platform is free to use, open to all, and completely independent because it’s funded by the people who use it. Our independence makes us a trusted resource for decision makers, who turn to the platform to hear from and respond to the communities they represent.

The nonprofit Change.org Foundation oversees both the Change.org Public Benefit Corporation (PBC), a wholly owned corporate subsidiary focused on technology, innovation and growth; and the Change.org charitable programs focused on empowering the most marginalized people and communities globally. This hybrid structure of two mutually supporting organizations enables us to combine the ambition and growth trajectory of a tech company with the mission-focused stewardship of a nonprofit.

As an organization, Change.org is committed to providing the tools, resources and support needed to empower anyone, anywhere to create the change they want to see.

We love serving our incredible users, and we love our staff too. We show it with competitive salaries, unlimited vacation, 18 weeks of parental leave, and a high impact, low-ego team that can’t wait to learn from you and teach you what they know.

If you’re like most Americans, you probably find it difficult to consistently buy premium grade seafood. Seafood fraud is running rampant in many parts of this country. In fact, a 2015 Oceana report showed that more than 40% of salmon in grocery stores and restaurants was mislabeled.

So, unless you have a trusted source, you’re likely not eating what you think you are.

With the Wild Alaskan Company, our goal is to create a fully transparent sea-to-table experience, where you always:

We all know someone that has struggled with mental health - 1 in 4 people have a treatable mental health condition - but the overwhelming majority don’t get the care they need.

To scale our mission, we’ve raised funding from the world’s preeminent VCs (backers of Facebook, LinkedIn, Slack, Uber, Oscar) as well as the nation’s most innovative healthcare entrepreneurs (founders of One Medical, Flatiron Health, and Clover Health).

One year later, Henri Nestlé, a trained pharmacist, launched one of the world’s first prepared infant cereals ‘Farine lactée’ in Vevey, Switzerland.

Today, we employ around 273,000 people and have factories or operations in almost every country in the world. With our headquarters still based in the Swiss town of Vevey, we had sales of CHF 84.3 billion in 2020.

Our portfolio covers almost every food and beverage category –offering products and services for all stages of life, every moment of the day, helping people care for themselves and their families.",https://www.nestle.com/,[],,/company/nestle

Sundance was founded in 1969 by Robert Redford when he purchased land at the base of beautiful 12,000-foot Mount Timpanogos in Utah's Wasatch Mountains. This pristine place became the Sundance Village, and at the base of the Village was a tiny store. Guests would frequently write letters to the store requesting special items they had seen while visiting Sundance, and thus the idea for Sundance Catalog was born.

It started small. Robert Redford called together a few of his colleagues to discuss starting a mail-order catalog to fill these requests and to make Sundance's unique items available to a wider audience. The first edition of Sundance Catalog was mailed in 1989, and since that first catalog, it remains the Sundance vision to share ""the kinds of things that we have been privileged to collect, many of them handcrafted exclusively for Sundance.""​

As Sundance has grown, we have remained rooted in the richness and diversity of the American experience. When you purchase something from this catalog, we appreciate the fact that the prime reason is enjoyment for yourself. But you are also supporting American craftspeople and efforts to enhance and preserve the artistic spirit.

Beginning with the first catalog that mailed in '89, Robert Redford has penned a special message that appears on the inside front cover of every edition. And, in the words of Robert Redford, ""To us, Sundance is and always will be a dream. What you see, smell, taste and feel here is a dream being carefully nurtured. It is an area whose pledge is to people. What we offer in the form of art and culture, spirit and service, is homegrown and available to all.""​",https://www.sundancecatalog.com/,[],,/company/sundance-holdings-group-llc

Because mindful movement in the studio leads to better living. It changes who yogis are off the mat, making their lives and their communities better. That’s the real meaning of studio-to-street: taking the consciousness from practice on the mat and putting it into practice in life.
That’s why we started Alo —to spread good: to anyone who is experiencing the transformative power of yoga, to the world’s best yogis who wear Alo to practice because it’s the only line that actually elevates their practice, to the celebrities and the fashion-forward who wear Alo because it’s the perfect street brand, comfortable, contemporary and decidedly not just for the mat.
Creating garments that carry over to the street, into a life lived consciously, takes mindful movement one step further: a beautiful life celebrated with beautiful design. Capturing what’s trending in contemporary fashion with both the women’s and men’s collections makes it so Alo can travel beyond the studio. Luxury meets performance in every collection.
Mindful movement carries over to life at Alo, where there’s a solar-powered office, yoga five days a week for employees at our on-site gym,  electric-car charging stations, an advanced recycling program that reduces waste to that of a small household, and meetings outside by the fountains in our meditative Zen garden. We have a gong. And we use it. Our stores are designed to be places to commune—people and ideas mingle over organic juice, kombucha and coffee. And the airy yoga studio and roof deck at our Beverly Hills flagship store is where it’s really happening.

Identifies organizations that are run in ways that make care better.

OUR WORK:
Saves thousands of lives.
Helps millions of people stay healthy.

The NCQA seal is a widely recognized symbol of quality. Organizations incorporating the seal into advertising and marketing materials must first pass a rigorous, comprehensive review and must annually report on their performance. 

NCQA’s programs and services reflect a straightforward formula for improvement: Measure. Analyze. Improve. Repeat. NCQA makes this process possible in health care by developing quality standards and performance measures for a broad range of health care entities. 

NCQA’s contribution to the health care system is measured through statistics that track the quality of care delivered by the nation’s health plans. Every year for the past five years, these numbers have improved; health care protocols have been refined, doctors have learned new ways to practice, and patients have become more engaged in their care. Those improvements in quality care translate into lives saved, illnesses avoided and costs reduced. 

NCQA consistently raises the bar. Accredited health plans today face a rigorous set of standards and must report on their performance in more than 40 areas in order to earn NCQA’s seal of approval. These standards promote the adoption of strategies that we believe will improve care, enhance service and reduce costs.",http://www.ncqa.org,[],,/company/ncqa

State of the art in every way.
Manufacturing a great part isn’t just about what the end product looks like. It’s about what it feels like, how it works, how it handles and performs. To ensure that each and every one of these elements meets the mil-spec standard, we look at the process from which the product was created at a holistic level.

We push the boundaries of manufacturing and challenge the status quo by constantly looking for new ways to use, develop or evolve existing processes. By personally designing and engineering state of the science tooling in-shop, we’re able to leverage the latest machine tool technologies to provide you with components of the highest quality.

Our investment, your benefit.
Rail guided robotic equipment, new horizontal machining centers with sophisticated monitoring devices and hydraulic tooling ensure consistent loading.

SoulCycle is so much more than a 45-minute indoor cycling workout — it’s always been about more than a bike. We provide a sanctuary for our riders to lose themselves in the movement and music. Our one-of-a-kind, world-class instructors guide our community through a powerful, fun and transformative fitness experience that’s designed to benefit the body, mind and soul, both on and off the bike. Set to high-energy music in a dark, candle-lit room, we move in unison to the beat and follow the signature choreography of our instructors. The Soul experience doesn’t end when the music stops.
 
SoulCycle is grounded in hospitality and honest, human connections are at the core of who we are.  As our fast-growing company evolves and expands, we remain as committed to nurturing the health and happiness of each employee as we are to each member of our community. We lift each other up, celebrate people for who they are and bring people together. We are a workout to some, a community to most and a safe harbor for all.
 
From our studios to our headquarters, we are a collaborative, fast-paced, and engaging place to work. And it’s vital to our success to continue to take risks and think big. It's what our community has come to expect from us and it's what they fell in love with when we launched. That takes tons of hustle, creativity, and boldness.
 
Our staff pushes themselves – and each other – to explore and to evolve and to bring more Soul to more people. SoulCycle’s continued success begins with each employee: their hospitality, their voice, their coaching, their creativity, their smart solutions, their energy, their spirit and their power.",http://www.soul-cycle.com/,[],,/company/soulcycle-hq

Income Share Agreements offer students an innovative alternative to traditional student loans. With an Income Share Agreement, you pay a small, fixed percentage of your future earned income over a 5 year term following graduation. We look at where you’re going, not where you’ve been, so rates are based on your expected earnings based on your program of study. Payments tied to income give students confidence that payments remain affordable, no matter their earnings. There is no accruing interest, no principal amount, and no hidden fees - all you pay is that small percentage of income over the 5 year term following graduation. ISAs are also considerably more flexible than traditional student loans, as borrowers never pay a dime if they make less than $40k/year. Because we only succeed when you do, we’re incentivized to help make your dreams a reality, which is why we provide career support and other membership benefits to each student we fund.

An LA native, founder Mike Amiri began his career in fashion by handcrafting unique stage pieces for iconic hard rockers such as Axl Rose and Steven Tyler. Eternally intrigued by such dark, heroic figures, his flair for tapping into this rock ‘n’ rock ethos led him to design an exclusive capsule collection for the LA-concept store, Maxfield. 

Since this debut collection, Mike established a distinct design signature with his deconstructed, hand-embellished denim jeans, leather jackets, grungy flannel shirting and graphic tee-shirts — all grounded in the nostalgic touchstones of his Californian youth. Early styles, like the MX1 jeans and Bandana Buckle boots, remain the pillars of AMIRI today, and the designer’s nascent DIY sensibility has since evolved into a studied and distinct savoir-faire. 

Today, AMIRI presents a collection bi-annually at Paris Fashion Week and is available from some of the most renowned retailers worldwide, such as Barneys, Bergdorf Goodman in New York, Galeries Lafayette in Paris, Selfridges in London and Joyce in Hong Kong. As its global presence grows, AMIRI remains faithful to its roots: each garment is still a labor of love, cut from the finest fabrics, produced in majority in LA, and often even hand-finessed in-house. More recently, production of leathergoods and tailored suiting moved to Italy. 

Since 2018, Mike Amiri has been a member of the CFDA. In 2018, he was also nominated for the Swarovski Award for Emerging Talent at the CFDA Fashion Awards and honored with the Emerging Talent Award at the Footwear News Achievement Awards.

Already surpassing human-level accuracy for many tasks, Vic.ai helps accountants, CFOs, controllers, and accounts payable (AP) teams become more efficient and reduce errors on routine tasks such as invoice processing, approval workflows, and electronic payment processing.

CPA firms can leverage their human workforce for cognitive tasks, while AI takes care of repetitive tasks, driving dramatic cost savings and profit margin improvements. This helps public accounting firms create balanced employee workloads during tax season, be more flexible, and protect against new business model threats.

CFOs and controllers from high-growth enterprise finance teams use Vic.ai to keep headcount under control, increase security, and reduce costly errors due to poor internal controls. By automatically entering invoices into accounting systems for human review, this changes the AP person’s workflow from data input to reviewing the AI.

Many accounting-, audit-, banking-, payroll-, and tax-related tasks are becoming fully automated with AI and machine learning. The accounting industry is being challenged in ways in which it has never seen during the past 500 years.

Due to its disruptive nature, Vic.ai is venture backed by some of the best investors in Silicon Valley (including Cowboy Ventures) and already helps industry leaders like PWC, KPMG, BDO, as well as many mid-sized firms.
